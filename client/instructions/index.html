      <p class="heading">Introduction</p>
      <p class="text">Pumpkin Smasher is an online game that requires 4 people to play. At the beginning of each game, 1 player is selected as 
  Pumpkin Master while the rest remain Skeletons. The goal of the Skeletons is to destroy all three objectives before the 5 minute timer runs out. On the other hand, the goal of the Pumpkin Master is to summon monsters and use abilities in order to stop the skeletons from destroying the objectives.</p>
      <div style="height: 3vmin"></div>
      <p class="heading">Objectives:</p>
      <p class="text">Three objectives are spawned randomly at the edges of the map. These objectives need to be protected at all costs by the Pumpkin Master and the Skeletons should do whatever they can to destroy them. Hitting an objective rewards 0.2 points.</p>

      <p class="heading">Skeleton Gameplay:</p>
      <p class="text">Skeletons are what you play as most of the time, the skeletons move using WASD and the arrow keys. They have an axe which can be swung using the space bar killing nearby monsters and pumpkins. A skeleton can only hit monsters on the side they are facing meaning that skeletons can be killed if surrounded on both sides.</p>
      <div style="height: 3vmin"></div>
      <p class="text">Smashing pumpkins and monsters spawned throughout the match increases a skeleton's score. When they get enough score, they can level up their health, speed and axe range.</p>

      <p class="subtext">Axe Range - Increases the distance that axe swings can hit enemys by 1/3 of a tile.</p>
